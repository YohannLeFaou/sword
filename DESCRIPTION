Description:
    sword is a package which implements the methology developed in (citer article).
    The main function of sword is weighted_regression_survival and allows to fit
    random forest and gam model to model a right censored variable, using IPCW.
    Different types of weights are available (Kaplan-Meier, Cox, random survival forest)
    and custom weights may be provided. Cox_regression and RSF_regression are functions
    which implement the 2 benchmarks based on Cox model and RSF model studied 
    in (citer article). These 3 sword functions are wrappers to other R packages
    which implement classical regression algorithms.
