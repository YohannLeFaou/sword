\description{
\code{Cox_regression} is a benchmark model we use in [Gerb. et al.] (see ยง?). To model the
variable \code{phi}\eqn{(T)}, where \eqn{T} is a right censored time and \code{phi} is a given function, we first
fit a Cox model to the data to estimate the survival function of \eqn{T} given the covariates. Then,
we deduce an estimator of \code{phi}\eqn{(T)} by integration of the function \code{phi} with respect
to the
estimated survival function. Different methods are available to assess the quality of fit of
\code{Cox_regression}. \code{Cox_regression} is a wrapper for the \code{\link[survival]{coxph}}
function\cr \cr
The notations we use are :
\itemize{
\item \eqn{C} : Censoring variable
\item \eqn{Y = min(T, C)}
\item \eqn{\delta = 1_{T \le C}}  (delta)
}
}

\item \emph{Evaluation criteria}

The quality of fit may be assess throught three different criteria. There are two main
criteria : \code{"weighted"} and \code{"concordance"}, and one criteria that is expimental : \code{"group"}.

\itemize{

\item \code{"weighted"} : the weighed criteria is described in ยง? of [Gerb. et al.]. This criteria aims
to estimate the quadratic error of the model in the context of right censoring. It has the form
\eqn{\sum_i W_i  (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} where \eqn{(y_i)i} are the censored targets of the model, \eqn{(W_i)i}
are the IPC weights, and \eqn{(\hat{y}_i)i} are the predictions made.

The \code{types_weights_eval} argument allows the use of four kinds of IPC weights :
\code{"KM"}, \code{"Cox"}, \code{"RSF"} and \code{"unif"}. The first three types of weights correspond
to different ways to estimate the survival function of the censoring. On the other hand, \code{"unif"}
corresponds to \eqn{W_i = 1} for all i.

Since the IPC weights may take too large values in some situation, \code{max_ratio_weights_eval} allows
to threshold the weights \eqn{(W_i)i} so that the ratio between the largest and the smallest weights doesn't
exceed \code{max_ratio_weights_eval}. If \eqn{W_max} is the maximum weight, considered weights are then
\eqn{min(W_i, W_max) / ( \sum_i min(W_i, W_max) ) }

You can also manually provide weights to be used for IPCW with the argument \code{mat_weights} (those
weights will also be threshold w.r.t. \code{max_ration_weights_eval}). \code{mat_weights} should be a
matrix satisfying \code{nrow(mat_weights) = nrow(data_train) + nrow(data_test)}, any numbers of
columns may be provided and then each column of the matrix corresponds to a type of weights.
Columns name of the matrix are taken as names for the different types of weights. If there is no
column name, then default names are "w1", "w2', ...


\item \code{"concordance"} : The concordance is a classical measure of performance when modelling
censored variables. It indicates if the order of the predicted values of the model is similar to
the order of the observed values. The concordance generalizes the Kendall tau to the censored case.


\item \code{"group"} : This is an experimental criteria that we didn't mention in [Gerb. et al.]. Here,
the idea to take the censoring into account is to measure errors given groups of observations and
not single observations. First, the test sample is ordered w.r.t. the predicted values of the
model. Second, respecting this order the test sample is splited into groups of size \code{v_bandwidht[1]}, or
\code{v_bandwidht[2]}, etc ... (each bandwidth in \code{v_bandwidht} corresponds to a different
score \code{"group"}).

Then, inside a group, an estimator of the survival function of \eqn{T} may be obtained by
Kaplan Meier, and we can deduce an estimator of \code{phi}\eqn{(T)} by integration. This estimator
of \code{phi}\eqn{(T)} may be
viewed as an "empirical" value of \code{phi}\eqn{(T)} inside the group.

On the other other hand, each observation of a group is associated to a prediction of \code{phi}\eqn{(T)}.
The prediction for the group may be defined as the mean of the predictions of the observations
inside the group.

The resulting group scores correspond to the classical quality of fit criteria (e.g. quadratic error,
Kendall tau, Gini index) but taken on groups and not on single observations.

The \code{"group"} criteria is interesting in the context of big database, in which sufficient
number of groups are available. This criteria has a high variance if applied to small test sample.
